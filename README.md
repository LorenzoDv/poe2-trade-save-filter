## POE2 chrome extension for Save Filter for Path of Exile 2 trade site


This extension adds a Save button to the Path of Exile 2 trade site. The button becomes active once a search is performed. If you're satisfied with the search results, you can choose to save the filter.

Once saved, click on the extension icon to edit the filter's description to help you remember it. Then, simply click on Filter Link and you'll be redirected to the site with all your filters applied.

This project is still under development and is open-source. You can check out the code on GitHub.

Feel free to share your feedback with me at the email address provided below.

Have fun and happy trading!

If you don't see the button, refresh the page.
